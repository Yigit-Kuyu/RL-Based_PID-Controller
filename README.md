# Info

The soft actor-critic algorithm is implemented for the path tracking of AV via PID in longitudinal control and Stanley in lateral control. This is also the usage of the RL algorithm in multi-dimension problems. The kinematic equations are derived from the basic bicycle model.

The figure below is taken from an episode while training the aforementioned algorithm:

The final result of the algorithm can be seen below:
